### Checklist

- The changes target the `main` branch. Backports will be evaluated and done by
  maintainers, when necessary.

Additionally, you should have:

- Rebased your branch onto `main` and applied `fixup` and/or `reword` to any
  noisy commits to clean up the branch history.
- Separated units of work into individual commits, each of which pass the test
  suite. Large code changes with only a single commit will not be accepted, but
  we can assist you in separating the work if that is causing trouble.
- Written each commit message descriptively and in
  [imperative mood](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches?h=v2.36.1#n181).
- Added or updated relevant tests.
- Added or updated relevant documentation.

Never update the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md), this will be done by maintainers
before the next release.
